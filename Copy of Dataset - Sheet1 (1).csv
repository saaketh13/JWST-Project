STScI-01GA6KNV1S3TP2JBPCDT8G826T.png (2000×1158) (stsci-opo.org),"What looks much like craggy mountains on a moonlit evening is actually the edge of a nearby, young, star-forming region NGC 3324 in the Carina Nebula. Captured in infrared light by the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, this image reveals previously obscured areas of star birth.

Called the Cosmic Cliffs, the region is actually the edge of a gigantic, gaseous cavity within NGC 3324, roughly 7,600 light-years away. The cavernous area has been carved from the nebula by the intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from extremely massive, hot, young stars located in the center of the bubble, above the area shown in this image. The high-energy radiation from these stars is sculpting the nebula’s wall by slowly eroding it away.  

NIRCam – with its crisp resolution and unparalleled sensitivity – unveils hundreds of previously hidden stars, and even numerous background galaxies. Several prominent features in this image are described below.

The “steam” that appears to rise from the celestial “mountains” is actually hot, ionized gas and hot dust streaming away from the nebula due to intense, ultraviolet radiation. 
Dramatic pillars rise above the glowing wall of gas, resisting the blistering ultraviolet radiation from the young stars.
Bubbles and cavities are being blown by the intense radiation and stellar winds of newborn stars.
Protostellar jets and outflows, which appear in gold, shoot from dust-enshrouded, nascent stars.
A “blow-out” erupts at the top-center of the ridge, spewing gas and dust into the interstellar medium. 
An unusual “arch” appears, looking like a bent-over cylinder.
This period of very early star formation is difficult to capture because, for an individual star, it lasts only about 50,000 to 100,000 years – but Webb’s extreme sensitivity and exquisite spatial resolution have chronicled this rare event.

Located roughly 7,600 light-years away, NGC 3324 was first catalogued by James Dunlop in 1826. Visible from the Southern Hemisphere, it is located at the northwest corner of the Carina Nebula (NGC 3372), which resides in the constellation Carina. The Carina Nebula is home to the Keyhole Nebula and the active, unstable supergiant star called Eta Carinae.

A foreground cluster, located 3.6 billion light-years away from Earth, is magnifying and bending the light of the distant universe beyond. In this image, astronomers discovered the light of an exploding star — more specifically, a Type Ia supernova — imaged three times, seen as points of light within the prominent red arc at the right-center of the image.

To achieve three images, the light traveled along three different paths. Since each path had a different length, and light traveled at the same speed, the supernova was imaged in this Webb observation at three different times during its explosion. The multiply-imaged supernova offers astronomers a unique way to calculate a new value for the Hubble constant — the rate at which the universe is accelerating. 

The field of G165 is known for a high rate of star formation of more than 300 solar masses per year, an attribute that correlates with higher supernova rates.

Gas and Dust
In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.

In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes. Its images are about the same resolution as Webb’s, but the gas and dust obscure a lot of the smaller-scale star formation.

Bright Central Spikes
Bright red diffraction spikes at a galaxy’s core in a Webb image can be a “calling card” of an active supermassive black hole, as seen in galaxy NGC 7496. Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.

In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.

Older Stars
Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue. (Read more about how color is precisely applied to Webb’s images.)

In comparison, the cores of Hubble’s image may appear yellower, washing the central region in a soft glow and fully obscuring individual points of light. Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe.)

Younger Stars
In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.

In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.

Star-Forming Regions
Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.

In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.

Background galaxies
Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.

In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.

Astronomers used the James Webb Space Telescope to look toward M82’s center, where a galactic wind is being launched as a result of rapid star formation and subsequent supernovas. Studying the galactic wind can offer insight into how the loss of gas shapes the future growth of the galaxy.

This image from Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) instrument shows M82’s galactic wind via emission from sooty chemical molecules known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are very small dust grains that survive in cooler temperatures but are destroyed in hot conditions. The structure of the emission resembles that of hot, ionized gas, suggesting PAHs may be replenished by continued ionization of molecular gas.

In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.

Star-Forming Regions
Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.

In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.

Background Galaxies
Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.

In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.

Galaxy NGC 1300 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.
